"Great. This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun.",positive
"Lame. Most people give this movie a 10 out of 10 because they don't consider the movie but rather how happy they were to discover it as a child but now, in 2005, it has become obviously outdated, the script is quite bad and the acting is even worse. Harrisson Ford obviously should have worked his acting better, which he happily did since that movie. I am sorry I cannot just keep on lying about this movie: this is for your kids but in now way should it be put among masterpieces. IMDb is a web site about movies, not about cult and self-proclaimed nerds or geeks. You have to determine how good is a movie according to artistical criteria, neither to your gregarious instinct nor to your attitude.",negative
"Great Murray. May be THE classic Bill Murray movie, with Murray, Ramis, Candy and other oddballs making it in the Army. There are three general sequences - Murray pre-Army, basic training, and the mission (occurring after Murray and Ramis ""borrow"" Army test vehicle with their MP girlfriends). Each of the sequences are funny, I personally like Murray pre-Army best and the mission least. Warren Oates as ""Sgt. Hulka"" is a modern classic. Over twenty years later and this is still the reigning service comedy.",positive
"Dated. Plagiarised. Perhaps this film was regarded as original and rather humorous in its country of origin way back in 1981, but it's now dated. Two idiots join the army and get knocked into fine servicemen -- wow, I'd never have thought of a plot like that! Come to think if it, I have heard of it before. It's a cheap knock-off of Boulting Brother's Private's Progress' (1956) in which an all-star cast playing a squad of misfits is knocked into fine servicemen, watched over by a tough, gruff about-to-retire drill sergeant. This downmarket US plagiarised version is just not in the same class. Bill Murray is just a dull pain-in-the ass who self-centred child-like persona is supposed to be comic. Warren Oates and John Candy in supporting roles are acceptable, with Oates almost reaching the standard set by William Hartnell.",negative
"This stirring movie in comic-strip style is packed with unbelievable car stunts, thrills, chills and noisy action. Violent movie about a futuristic road-warrior cop with high-velocity action and kinetic energy .This classic is set a few years from now, a dangerous, desolate post-industrial world of the future where rules the strongest law . It concerns about the ex-police named Max (Mel Gibson), some cutthroats and revenge takes place. The nasties attack , rape, ravage to hapless and unfortunates. But vengeance will be terrible against some bands of depraved crazies thirsty for blood on high facility roads. A group (commanded by Mike Preston) located at an oil fortress is besieged by motorised warlords looking for fuel and they'll have to fight against the cutthroats, a band of depraved crazies (Vernon Welles and several others) thirsty for blood and survive some battles to-the-death with lots of blood and gore, including throating-slit ,beheading, impaling and blow up. This exciting picture packs kinetic action , thrills, chills, shocks and abundant violence. Spectacular stunt-work plenty of motorcycle races, cars with bounds and leaps and explosions . Top-notch Mel Gibson as revenger angel at one of his first main roles, he embarks a spectacular escape against vicious murderous. Rumbling and screeching musical score fitting to action by Brian May. Special and weird futuristic atmosphere created by cameraman Dean Semler who reflects splendidly the barren outdoors. The motion picture is stunningly directed by George Miller, author of the excellent post-apocalypse ¨Mad Max¨ trilogy along with the writer and producer Byron Kennedy. It's followed by ¨Mad Max beyond Thunderdome¨ with Tina Turner, George Ogilvie, Frank Thring and again Bruce Spence as sympathetic helicopter pilot. In addition, numerous imitations as the recent ¨Doomsday¨(2008, Neal Marshall), rip offs, and exploitations ,especially Italians products. Rating : Good, better than average, this is one of the most successful Aussie movie of all time. This remarkable action film will appeal to Science Fiction buffs. Rating : 8'5, Above average. Well worth watching.",positive
"I did not like it, not my type of film 'Mad Max 2' is a spin-off of the original 'Mad Max', and it's got the similar feel involving gangs of violent motorcyclists in the Australian outback. This time, Max is protecting a gang of people and fuel from the motorcyclists after the end of the world. A similar plot endures involving Mad Max with motorcycles hunting down the gang. Partly a matter of personal taste, a bunch of men riding around on motorcycles, killing each other, and generally being violent just does not make a good movie for me. Give me something with a little more substance and less pointless action. It's a guy's film, through and through, I think. Not my type of film: 1/10.",negative
"One of my Favorite Bonds. This is the very first Bond movie that I can remember enjoying as a kid back when it was HBO a long time ago a year or so after it came out. It helped get me hooked on 007. After James in Space in Moonraker, he is back down to Earth in this very exciting installment of the series. Definitely a step up over Moonraker. Great action scenes. Movie slows down a little here and there but when it picks up it rocks... literally, at one point, when James does a little rock climbing. And in this, Roger Moore's fifth Bond film, we finally get to see him playing baccarat, something he hadn't previously done and something Connery did in almost all his films. So minor compared to the international intrigue and chase scenes but I thought worth mentioning. This is absolutely one Bond film I look forward to seeing again!",positive
"One of the most boring and foreseeable. I remember going to the movies in Madrid when I was 15 to watch that year's 007. I remember a surprise to see how Spain was, once again, depicted. The action with the Citroen is supposed to be filmed in Spain, near Madrid!! Goatees and sheep in the city, women with scarves on their head, a Mediterranean forest, the most funny was to see people harvesting olives...hahahahaha. Mixed feelings about feeling embarrassed for the ignorant producers and movie director, and feelings about they did it once again. Well they should be better have done near Granada, or Jaen, but near Madrid, no way! I don't need to explain why, but anyway I guess British people is the image that had about Spain due to their holidays in Southern Spain...On the other hand besides that surprising part, the rest was completely foreseeable. Carole Bouquet was a beautiful model, but not still an actress. At the final part any shot of a person feet immediately had another shot of that person slipping down, I knew what it was going to happen long before it happened. Definitively one of the worse 007's",negative
"Hi Snake, . . . I heard you were dead! . Many fans of Kurt Russell were extremely surprised he emerged from his years as a child actor to evolve into a believable, hard hitting, action hero. True, he was traditionally recognized to many for his whimsical, good-looks and high school persona. Thus when movie-goers saw him in this film, many stood aghast at his mature tenor. This futuristic story begins with the President's plane being high-jacked by rebel extremists and flown into the island city of New York which has been transformed into a maximum prison. The plane with the president (Donald Pleasence) on board crashes into the prison and it falls to the warden/Police Commissioner, one, Bob Hauk, (Lee Van Cleef) to rescue the chief executive. His plan? To send in a new convict, an experienced ex-soldier and special ops veteran, named, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) with the promise of a presidential pardon if he can return him alive. To insure the clever criminal does not take the opportunity to escape, he is given a lethal injection which can only be removed by the commissioner's medical staff. Thus, begins a timely drama which means life or death for the hero, the president and ultimately the world. The success of this film owes much to the film's other characters like the talkative Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine, terrific acting), Harold ' Brain' Helman (Harry Dean Stanton), his 'squeeze' Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau) and Isaac Hayes, who plays the heavy, The Duke of New York. This a groundbreaking film for Russell and as expected, he carries it to it's rave conclusion with action to spare.",positive
"Cult film that does not stand test of time. I have to admit, I was expecting a lot more here, and as such I was disappointed. This movie does not measure up even to cult status, with a gruff, almost non-existent acting job by Russell, stupid bad guys, and terrible dialog. This would not even be a solid indie by todays standards. There are other sci-fi cult films from this period that translate well to modern day (ie, Road Warrior, also from 81'), this one does not IMO. Carpenter had a solid premise, but it gets lost with a insufficient budget, and bad acting. I cant understand why Snake became such a iconic character off this movie alone. I have not seen Escape from LA as of yet, but it would have to really be great to make up for the lackluster EFNY.",negative
"This Is What Mental Illness Looks Like. It's not pretty. Overacting? Only someone who has never seen this in real life, because they haven't lived with someone like this, would say it's over acted. It's serious and horrible. I feel people have treated this film like it's a fictional story. This is the terrifying account from someone who lived through it - not a made up horror script. Time people woke up. Great Movie.",positive
"Oy Faye. This may very well be one of the most loathsome and sloppy screen treatments to ever have been derived from a literary memoir. I only noticed four distinct areas in which ""Mommie Dearest"" is a complete disaster: the screenplay, the acting, the direction and the editing. Other than that, this is a fine film. Director Frank Perry delivers what could be one of the sloppiest directing jobs ever released by a major studio. He simply sits back and lets Dunaway rip. He was either supremely untalented or he purposefully intended to sabotage her. The narrative is chopped up worse than a Thanksgiving turkey, with a bizarre and fragmented collection of scenes showcasing little but mass hysteria. Dunaway does not chew scenery. Dunaway starts neatly at each corner of the set in every scene and swallows it whole, costars and all. Oy Faye!",negative
"Excalibur. The best of the King Arthur films. Excalibur is a truly atmospheric film. It has the ability to take you back to the time it depicts, without using sentimentality or rose tinted spectacles. Having seen the film numerous times, I still get more out of it with every viewing. It certainly seemed to start many careers on the right path and many of the actors are very well known now. My only sadness is that Paul Geoffrey and Nigel Terry, two of the main character actors, seem not to have become such household names. They both stand out in the film and to my mind have made it what it is, brilliant. Great direction, production, photography and music. King Arthur himself would have been proud of it.",positive
"the pain! the pain!. This is among the worst movies I have seen. I once read that the Monty Python boys (having made the hilarious and very clever Monty Python and the Holy Grail in 1975) were amazed to see this movie; it contains essentially everything that they parodied in their own film, but it is so terribly earnest about everything. The dialogue is pretty awful but nothing compared to the shocking performances of all the actors involved. And WHY OH WHY must they wear plate armour all the time? apart from being historically inaccurate its just stupid from a common sense point of view. All in all I can see nothing good about Excaliber, except possibly for the unintentional giggles at its awfulness.",negative
"A Horrific Masterpiece. Sam Raimi proved to the world that he could not only direct a movie but that he could create a product that was not only original but that could scare the hell out of you. Since the 1981 release, Bruce Campbell has found work on many film projects due to his break out performance in the Evil Dead. Raimi, has gone on to direct many films. Both have earned much of their career based on this little horror movie, that has been re-produced / recycled by thousands of ""wanna-be"" film makers world wide. This is not your typical ""zombie"" film, let alone your garden variety horror movie as well. The Evil Dead is one of those black comedies / horror movies that overwhelms the audience to either be scared out of their wits or won over by the movie's story and over the top characters. The Evil Dead is what most, if not all horror movies should be, very real and powerful.",positive
"No. First off, let me say that this type of movie doesn't really tickle me. It is possible, though, that through wit and cleverness win me over. This one failed miserably. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Not only did it fail to provide me with an answer, ""Evil Dead"" made me just laugh outright at its awfulness. For being ultra low budget, it was well made. But apart from the gross-out effects, this movie could have been made by a monkey.",negative
"Take it from a real submariner. on modern ""boats"" life isn't easy- but compared to the living hell that the German U-Boats were, modern submariners have nothing to complain about. People in certain professions don't like to watch movies about those professions (Doctors and Nurses shy away from hospital dramas, for example). Submarine sailors are different. We love to watch every submarine movie ever made, from ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""Destination: Tokyo"" to ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"" and ""U-571"". Why? Because we can always use a good laugh. For those in the know, submarine movies are usually absolutely hilarious. Except this one. After being in the Navy for four years, serving with around 350 different men, and being acquainted with a further 200-300, all of them submarine sailors, I think that I can state with absolute certainty that this film is the ONLY submarine movie that ALL submariners take seriously. And that is the highest praise a movie like this can possibly get.",positive
"It's claustrophobic, so what?!?!. If you are looking for great movie in any artistic aspect, forget this one! Das boot is tedious. Boring, boring, boring... It looks like the same scene was repeated over and over again. It's almost an eternal déjà vu. Bad taste, awful acting, couple of pseudo-mysterious ""visages"" filmed and poor storyline. Even if you consider its historic value is unbelievably flat and void. I've already seen thousands of documentaries much more interesting than this movie. Hope I save you the two hours I have wasted. Try something like Inglorious Bastards, Saving Private Ryan, or whatever, because this movie my dear readers, is unbearable. I would rather run endlessly instead of watching it again.",negative
"Ooooo. Scary. The old adage of the simplest ideas being the best is once again demonstrated in this, one of the most entertaining films of the early 80's, and almost certainly Jon Landis' best work to date. The script is light and witty, the visuals are great and the atmosphere is top class. Plus there are some great freeze-frame moments to enjoy again and again. Not forgetting, of course, the great transformation scene which still impresses to this day.",positive
"Woof!. What is the deal with this movie? So many people's favorite werewolf movie, so many's favorite horror/comedy. I liked the humor, the one transformation scene and the full-frontal male nudity, but it's hardly a great werewolf movie. #1 he turns into a dog, so not a scary werewolf to me and even when he's a monster SOOO late into the movie, they barely ever show him except in close-ups that could've been filmed anywhere or even months following the film's wrap. It's okay and I remember the sequel being awful, but it's not something I'd like to see again. WTG on practical effects, but a stinker of an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion.",negative
"A Guilty Pleasure. All of us have certain films, not well liked by either critics or public, which nonetheless really strike a chord within us. They're our guilty pleasures, movies that we never tire of, but don't brag about. ""Porky's"" is one of mine. It's insipid, inane, and amateurish. The plot doesn't make much sense, and the characters don't behave rationally. But I don't care. ""Porky's"" is fun, transporting me back to a mythical time in America when it was great to be a teenager. Life was a lark, issues were black and white, and all endings are happy. In this regards ""Porky's"" resembles many of Disney's movies like ""Pollyanna"", a haunt of other guilty pleasures. Sheer fantasy, sheer entertainment. I dig this movie, but that's just my opinion.",positive
"A jumbled mess. Porky's, the 1981 sex comedy, was popular among teenagers, and maybe some teens today might like it, who knows? But this movie IS NOT well made at all. The acting is so- so at best, the script is dull and poorly put together, and the characters are just stupid annoying teens who are SEX OBSESSED. I absolutely hated the characters in this movie, especially the main guy that is trying to lose his virginity. The amount of nudity and just disgustingly sexual scenes in this movie is almost shocking. For example, the shower scene where a teenage boy sticks his **** through a hole in the girls shower room, and the big female teacher comes and just grabs it! Eww! That wasn't even funny, it was just gross! That is what porky's suffers from, it's just not funny, it's just a bunch of horny teens doing nasty things and trying to outwit some sleazy night club owner. It's boring, dull, and poorly written. There are some sex comedies that are funny, this is not one of them. 2/10 for Porky's.",negative
"Great Tribute to the 80's. I loved this show and I think I will love it forever. It was beauty and luxury at its best. People may criticise it on the grounds that the situations were unbelievable and acting was stiff, I think that was the only way the show could work and become what it undeniably became: unique. Dynasty was a shrine to the excesses of the 80's. Probably nobody was too natural back then, so the cast should be given credit for adopting a pace that suited the show and that was key to its success. Ratings might have sunk, but that is always bound to happen. However, almost 20 years later and the show always gives plenty to talk about, is synonym of luxury (even for people who did not follow the show or weren't even born then). That must be worth something. I am sure anyone you ask is likely to know who Alexis Carrington is. I truly wish these days there would be shows were you could see beautiful women (of all ages - even if they had tons of make-up ans stuff) an immaculate scenery and splendid props. Dynasty - in ts kind - was perfection and the best A Spelling has produced in my opinion. Pamela Sue Martin, Pamela Bellwood and Katherine leaving the cast was a big blow I think, but - personally - did not stop remaining hooked. Only no no was the UFO (let's ignore that).",positive
"Dynasty the Christ as. I was given theD entire box set of the original Dynasty for Christmas and what a load of drivel it was.Everyone was wooden, John Forsythe especially, Joan Collins screeched her way through it like a demented banshee and the wigs were dreadful, a tsunami would not have made the casts hair move. Will not be watching again I found it strenuous to watch once!",negative
"A Worthy Sequel. While most sequels cash in on their original movie's fame, the second part of the Friday the 13th series lives up to its name. Unlike the first movie, Jason stars in this movie while his ""mother"" has the cameo. The gore and the kill scenes surpass the original. The characters are true teenage stereotypes. Much like the ending in the original, the ending here is great. A jump out of your seat moment that lives up to the original. This is way before Jason wears his hockey mask. Here we are witnessed to a masked killer that uses a pillow case to hide his scary identity. From here on, the fame of PART 2 made it possible for the next bunch of films to happen. It is pretty much all down hill from here. While some of those films lived up to being great horror movies, most fell short and could not recycle the same effect that PART 2 had on its audience.",positive
"Not a good sequel. One year after the first Friday the 13th, we got a sequel. Let me be honest. This is yet another horror film that lacks originality. The plot in this film is essentially the same as the first film. What we do get though is the debut of one of the most iconic horror movie characters, Jason Voorhies. With a film that has the same plot, one would become bored. Which is what this film is. It did not have suspense and I was not really scared at all. The kills are great and this film shows how Jason kills people. The acting is not great but far from being the worst that I have seen. I suppose what this film is is just a somewhat forgettable film that is just the same as the previous film.",negative
"one of my all-time favourites!!!!!!!. Okay, realistically speaking, it is not ""excellent"" in the grand scope of cinema history...It has virtually no plot, for example. But it's hysterically funny and just makes you feel happy all over. Could it be Sammy Davis Junior and Dean Martin paired as drunken priests in a red Ferrari that makes it so great? Is it the doctor of mysterious origin (""Don't you EVER tell me where you found him!"" who seldom needs more than his middle finger for an examination? Perhaps it's Mr Uh, Mr Uh,...Foyt! No, the greatest reason for watching this film is for the sheer joy of experiencing Dom Deluise in orange spandex saving the world...and don't forget! ""Hamsters are a big responsibility!""",positive
"Watchable, but really stupid. I'll confess that there were a few times when I laughed while watching this film, as much as I hate to admit that fact. Nevertheless, this film is about as brainless and plotless as major motion pictures can get. Most of the jokes land hard with a thud, and the racing scenes are standard at best. It is a mildly amusing distraction, but let's face it, you can do MUCH better than this if you're looking for a good time. Watch only if you have the need to see an enormous bunch of talent being pitifully wasted.",negative
"A Slasher Gem. The 1980's. What a decade. A decade known for bad fashion and hair bands, but also known as the decade of the slasher film. With the multitude of slasher flicks that came out in the 80's it was inevitable that some would be overlooked. The Burning is one of those great slash flicks. Filmed in the same location as Friday the 13th and unfairly compared to it. However The Burning kicks Friday the 13th to the curb. The Burning is about a camp caretaker who after being horribly disfigured by a group of campers playing a prank comes back for sweet vengeance. A dish best served bloody thanks to Tom Savini and his genius effects. This flick has it all. All the ingredients that make a good slash flick, you know what kind of stuff I mean. (T&A BABY!!, plenty of the red stuff and that unique brand of dialogue.) The story although now cliche doesn't miss a step. Definetly a must see for all slash fans. Oh yeah. The infamous raft scene you've heard so much about is AWESOME! Jason could have never pulled a stunt like that. KEEP SLASHIN!",positive
"Watch ""Friday the 13th"" instead!. It's pretty obvious that the creators of The Burning was making a clone of Friday the 13th. It's nothing else than plagiarism. A disfigured, insane monster/janitor/burn-victim with the strength of ten men, slaughtering a bunch of sex-crazed teenagers on summercamp.The only cool thing about this move is the actors. A young Jason Alexander and Holly Hunter appears in this movie. That's about it. This is not a scary movie. I give it a 1/10.",negative
"Pretty good movie. This was actually a lot better than I expected. I'm more from a Monty Python humor background and some of the Mel Brooks humor is pretty campy and dated in a Marx Bros sense but it was still pretty darn good. It's hard not to like a guy who turns the Spanish Inquisition into a musical. I guess there's something for everyone to like (and be offended by).",positive
"One of the biggest disappointments ever. I went to see this movie when it first came out hoping to find another great Brooks film such as my favorite- ""Blazing Saddles."" I remember sitting stone faced throughout waiting for it to get good and even being offended just a little bit. My girlfriend loves this movie so she got me to watch it and I must say 20 years has not changed my perception one bit as far as this film goes. I think I may have guffawed once or twice and apart from that sat through countless awkward moments and blown gags. I actually felt sorry for Mel in some scenes and found myself thinking I wasn't going to make it through, but alas, it is mercifully short which saves it from being among the absolute worst of all time. This movie marked the end of one of the greatest comedic filmmakers career, but I guess some people didn't realize it!",negative
"love this movie. I just saw this movie again for the first time in almost 20 years. This was the greatest, it really touched me when i was a teenage. I saw it with my first love and still to this day I think of him when I see it or think about it. After reading the other comments on this movie it is hard for me to understand how some people dont love it. I think i love it so much because of when i first saw it, I was a teenage in 1981 and it was like nothing i ever saw before. People who are seeing it for the first time now might not get it the same way. My daughter is a teen now and I would like to watch it with her and see what she thinks. this movie will always have a special place in my heart.",positive
"endless bore. It's not a terrible movie, despite the wooden performances of the two lead actors. But this story of obsessive love and tragedy never becomes involving or interesting, and feels like it's much too long despite the relatively short running time. The film does have two redeeming factors: beautiful cinematography and the legendary title song.",negative
"Call No Man Happy Who is Not Dead. With lines like that what can one say? This film comes to life solely on the strength of the supporting cast: Sir Lawrence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Burgess Meredith, Neal McCarthy (Calibos). Harry Hamlin and the very pretty English girl who plays Andromeda may not be great actors but they do look the parts they play. The special effects of Mr. H., while passe' in this digital age, are pretty good. I have seen this film a few times and always enjoy it.",positive
"The pits. An awful mix of babyish effects and great actors. You wonder why this stinks so much , I mean, Haussen's ""Jason and the Argonauts"" was older, maybe less accomplished, and magical. This thing is a groan fest. Olivier, Bloom, Meredith - these are superlative actors, why are they in this thing? It's not an Actor's movie - the point is to tell a story, entertain kids, and kids don't need to know Olivier is Zeus, just get on with the action. But the action seemed so laboured, totally lacking the flair and intrigue that marked Ray's earlier films. Were they trying too hard to make an epic in the great style with all this talent? Then they should not have had all these toy monsters flying around, it's an imbalance in genres, and as for that owl, you just want to shoot it, honestly.",negative
"best of the alien rip offs. When i saw the trailer for galaxy of terror i knew it was going to be good,as a roger Corman produced b-movie it is a wild ride.sort of like alien on a lower budget.it stars Eddie Albert Jr.zalman king,Sid haig, ray walston(my favorite martian)Robert englund(nightmare on elm street) Erin Moran(Joanie on TV's happy days)and grace zabriskie(twin peaks) its bizarre science fiction horror about a group of space travelers on a rescue mission encountering terrors of all sorts,a women is raped by a giant worm,now thats bizarre.James Cameron was involved in the production.critics bashed this and it was one of the movies on the DVD 50 worst movies of all time,sorry i don't agree.its the best of the alien rip offs.7 out of 10",positive
"A grindhouse variation of ""Alien""... Rescue spaceship manned by bickering group of specially-trained astronauts, and captained by a megalomaniac female with a spotty past history, lands on desolate planet to help out a comrade ship and become unwitting victims of their own worst fears manifested. James Cameron worked as the co-production designer and second unit director of this low-budget science-fiction crud from Roger Corman and New World Pictures, one that hopes to resemble ""Alien"" (but played at the wrong speed). An interesting cast including Grace Zabriskie, Robert Englund and Zalman King, find themselves at mercy of cut-rate special effects and ludicrous dialogue, although the sets and costumes are decent. Horror scenes emphasize torture...not to mention the sexual assault of a worm-hating blonde by way of a giant maggot. * from ****",negative
"A great memory from my youth. I was a teen watching this movie and at the time it was amazing. The soundtrack was very diverse with bands from across the board. The stories were also very cool and funny. This movie has tons of funny moments and if you are of this generation, you need to have this in your collection. Every once in a while during guy times we put this on in the background and it always ends the night with a smile on our faces. Before its time, and now its timeless. With the pathetic garbage out there now like high school musical, and the Britney Spears, Paris Hilton gang, I have no problem lauding about this movie of my youth. Long live Heavy Metal!",positive
"Worst animated film ever. This movie is bad in every way conceivable. It's a adult-oriented yet approached in a very immature manner. The animation is anywhere from sketchy to stiff and dead. The plots in each of the stories only serve the singular purpose of indulging in whatever immoral and ridiculous themes that the writers thought of. The film as a whole is just shallow and mindless, like living out some immature adolescent comic book geek's dream. You don't sit through this film, you trudge painfully through it. For a film that requires no thought whatsoever, this movie causes your head to hurt too much. Why waste your time with it? There are better adult-oriented animated films from the era, see those.",negative
"Loosely based on actual events. I was in Palm Beach in the 1960's when the trial of Irene Von Maxey of Sebring, Florida and bookie John Sweet of Boston were tried for the murder of Irene's very wealthy husband. Despite overwhelming evidence Irene was not convicted and inherited her murdered husbands estate. It was later determined that before and during the trial she was having an affair with the prosecuting attorney. Her picture ran in the Palm Beach Post and she was no Kathleen Turner but John Sweet who, I believe, was convicted, and the D. A. must have thought differently. If Body Heat was not based on this murder it is one of the greatest coincidences I've seen. Great movie.",positive
"Terrible garbage. 'Film noir'? Well, yes. That is the most abominable genre of film and this was in there with all the other putrid film noir garbage vomited up over the years. Hurt is not an actor. He may just qualify as being a human being, but if he has ever shown an emotion, please point it out. This tedious film bored me rigid. HURT bored me rigid. Why was this piece of crap made? If anyone can offer a solution then please proffer it up with your Hurt-emotion suggestion. Then there was all that sweating! Is that why i hated it? No, no. The sweating was ghastly, but i hated this film because it was a very, very, bad film. Sleep-inducing rot.",negative
"Hold on a second: This isn't even rated a 7 on the IMDB?! This has got to be one of the most underappreciated Disney classics yet. The Fox and the Hound is probably the most heartwarming Disney film yet. It mixes humor, action, and romance as well as any other Disney film, except for a select few such as Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Mulan, or Tarzan. Nevertheless, I cannot believe this is rated only a 6.6. Several Disney films that are rated above this movie come nowhere near close to it in quality (i.e. Snow White, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty, etc...). I cannot comprehend how it is rated so low...9/10 (Ranks right up there with the likes of Robin Hood and Pinocchio).",positive
"What a waste of time. As to not repeat, I'm going to second everything wowarning posted. I am flabbergasted at comments such as ""under-rated"", ""heart-warming"", etc. This movie is anything but. Even the comic relief is worse than in a Star Wars movie. If anything saddens me about this movie is that I actually wasted my time watching it. I watched it as a preview for my kids. I was a bit surprised at the level of violence for a ""G"" movie. I would say it borders PG rating. Lots of gun fire (complete with near-misses and ricocheting bullets), growling/showing teeth, anger, satanic bear with glowing red eyes, biting, fighting, etc. This is definitely not for young children.",negative
"Still a wonderful film!. I loved the soundtrack to this film and I was glad to watch it on Oscar Sunday. It is worthy of its' Oscars and is based on a true story. The music can be haunting and beautiful at the same time. Vangelis is a musical genius. The cast is stellar with some new faces of actors and actresses like Alice Krige and even Ruby Wax if you look closely. The 1924 Olympics is the climax of the film. It's still a beautiful and wonderfully entertaining and educational film to be seen. I loved the cast including Sir Ian Holm, Sir John Gielgud, and the young aspiring Olympic athletes including Brad Davis, Ian Charleson, and Ben Cross. The story is beautifully told in writing and the direction is brilliant to convey the beauty of the story. This is a feel good classic film from 1981.",positive
"Grass growing is more entertaining! I am a very well educated and tolerant man and father. I feel that is necessary to say before my comment on the movie. I don't want those pseudo-intellectuals summing up my feelings on this movie by saying that I am just an uneducated bumpkin. With that being said....I sat on my front lawn yesterday and watched my grass grow for a few moments and I found that more fascinating and entertaining than this movie. I feel for those that are discriminated against and I think that it is a tragedy that people suffer as they do for the color of their skin or the type of religion they choose to worship. However, that does not excuse this movie. I have made a real effort not once, but twice to watch this movie and I have to admit I have yet to see the whole thing! I would never recommend this movie to anyone unless they were suffering from insomnia. This movie would put even the worst insomniac to sleep in no time! I am considering showing this movie to my pre-teen that never likes to go to sleep so that I can get her to sleep by her bed time.",negative
"awesome werewolf flick. This is an excellently crafted piece of work from former Roger Corman student, Joe Dante. I won't go much into the plot, but it involves a news woman who gets attacked while in a porno shop viewing room. To get her mind off things, a psychiatrist recommends she goes to his private retreat to be treated. After that, spooky happenings and strange deaths start occurring. This film has great direction and great atmosphere and mood. The lighting and use of fog is excellent and really hightens the spookiness of the film. One of the best werewolf transformations is shown in this film, rivaled only by the one in An American Werewolf in London. Although this movie starts out slow, the tension keeps rising and keeps you interested in what will happen next. The spookiness doesn't always lie within the content but also the claustrophobic feeling and the uncertainty of who you can trust. A very good movie, highly recommended.",positive
"Incredibly overrated, mediocre horror movie. I haven't seen many werewolf movies. Maybe this one is considered the best by many people, because the rest is total crap. I really don't understand those 8+ ratings. The only reason a gave it 4 stars instead of 2 is because of the special effects which are quite well done for their time. I totally agree with people who say the storyline is very slow. You won't be missing anything at all if you'd skip the first hour. This may seem a useless comment, but I really don't have very much to say about this movie, since it's neither awful nor something special. It's just mediocre and boring. You might wonder why I almost gave 2 stars, while saying it's mediocre. Well total crap is sometimes more entertaining than a mediocre movie, so this one shouldn't easily get 5 stars in my opinion.",negative
"Simply one of the Greatest. I looked forward to this show every week! It was fun, funny, and action filled... there was even some romance! It was slightly spoiled when John Hinckley shot at the president, because the mid-stream name change was dubbed in badly. The company that made this decision was wrong. I wish I could watch the series all over again.",positive
"OMG! A dreadful memory from my teen years. From the 1st episode I hated this, but I had to watch it because of a family member. So many opportunities to be a great show lost. If I was to try to write a show that was annoying and everyone would hate, this would be it. This or mork and Mindy. Wasted William Katts career.",negative
"Great movie. This a great movie for any football fan. A great set of stars from the 70's, Pele and Stallone as a funny goalkeeper. This is one of my favorite soccer movies. The storyline is not the best, but it is catchy. Now the way the stadium was set up, the noise, it feel really real. I would love to see a similar movie remade. Maybe a victory 2 with todays's stars. Some people do not like the idea of sly as a football player, I disagree, I think he playing the "football-ignorant"american is good. Now I also think that the way the soccer players acted was very realistic. In special Pele was good. I know many friends in many countries outside the USA who just love this film.",positive
"Unrealistic to say the least. Despite its big name cast, to include Michael Caine and Max von Sydow, Victory leaves one feeling flat. Something like what is envisioned here simply could not have happened during WWII because allied soldiers would have never put themselves in the position of even remotely offering the Germans a chance at a propaganda coup. The plot basically revolves around former English soccer player Michael Caine, now a POW, having a chance encounter in a prison camp with German officer von Sydow. The two basically hatch the plan of a soccer game between allied prisoners and the German national team. This is where the plot starts to unravel. Caine makes numerous demands such as excellent food, housing, uniforms, etc. and gets them all...very unlikely! The game it is decided, will be held in Paris. Again wouldn't the Germans be more apt to choose Berlin where they could exert total control over the goings on, rather than risk some fiasco in occupied but still hostile Paris? Of course the ending is no surprise as is typical in war movies of this kind. It's all been seen before, not even Bill Conti's brilliant score, probably the best thing about this movie, can save it.",negative
"Solid Stallone. ""Nighthawks"" is one of Sylvester Stallone's better efforts. I'm saying that as a fan of most of Sly's movies. This movie was trying to do something different with the cop genre and in many ways it succeeded. It has a good story and a very strong villain. The cast, including Stallone, all give very nice performances. Sly wears eyeglasses in this movie. Not many leading men have the guts to try for realism like that. The NYC location photography is terrific. It plays a huge part in my enjoyment of this movie. This movie has quite a few edge-of-your-seat moments. I enjoyed ""Nighthawks"" when I saw it in the theater (Bellerose, NY) and I enjoyed it tonight. Honorable mention: the disco scene.",positive
"The Off Switch Was Never So On. The film opened with quite possibly the worst theme music I have ever heard. If a tone deaf cat could play the fiddle it would still have come up with something better. The film titles sequence looks like it was written on cardboard. And then the film itself - how 80s can you get? Talk about dated. Looked like cheap porno filmed on Super 8! Still, Sly looks cute with his beard and Lindsay Wagner is in it so I give it a chance. That chance was up about ten minutes into the film with the drugs bust. Cartoon characters in a loft. Motherf dialogue. And Sly's accomplice in fear of losing it. Yawn! The off switch was never so on.",negative
"Fantastic. Dragonslayer is a great fantasy film. The special effects hold up fairly well even today. The dragon is just a model and it looks fantastic. I was only 9 years old when I saw this film and it has stuck with me ever since. There are great performances and the direction is tight. The set design is also done well. Dragonslayer has a great atmosphere and you won't forget the image of the dragon rising from the water behind our hero anytime soon.",positive
"Ouch!. I cannot believe this film had 2 Oscar nominations; one for fx and the other for best original score. Even taking onto account the year (1981), the special effects are woeful. I csn think of plenty of films prior to this which have effects that are light years ahead of these. The score is like one from "an after school special". The rest is completely forgettable. Please don't waste you time watching a minute of this pablum.",negative
"Beautiful. This movie is very splendid. Not only was there a wonderful cast and great acting, the scenery was very beautiful. I was enthralled in the fact that there were no spoken words identifiable by any common language today. I definitely prefer it over any ""half-naked cave woman running around in leopard-skin bikini"" caveman movie out there. I would recommend it to fans of all movie genres, because it combines all of the aspects of great movies -- comedy, action, suspense, romance -- into a CAVEMAN movie. And it's pretty interesting to see how they do that.",positive
"horrible in all respects. In 1981, the advance reviews for this film were outstanding. The Detroit area critics could not say enough about how great it was and they particularly heralded Rae Dawn Chong. So, the four of us went to see it on the Friday night that it opened in the theaters. It was crowded, of course, because of the glowing reviews. Well, this goes down as one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my 60 years of moviegoing. Bizarre and almost hideous. When it ended, the audience just sat there in stunned silence at first. Gradually, people got up groaning and complaining about what they just sat through. What a waste of time and money. The critics really scammed us on this one. As for Chong, this did nothing for her career. The stink of this movie still lingers after 40 years.",negative
"Check out the piano score. Ofcourse this is a pretty great film; great special effects with minor exceptions, great plot, bad acting with minor exceptions, etc... What I really liked was the music composed by Fabio Frizzi. First we've got this great ""goblin-esque"" Italian horror music (for those of you who don't know, Goblin is this band that provided music for several Italian horror films, such as Tenebre.) My favorite cue is the theme for the blind lady with the dog. It has a piano playing a very haunting melody to a set background chord. The theme reappears pretty much whenever that lady appears. I first watched this film on VHS with the cut version and it was boring as hell. But yesterday in the new releases of Scarecrow Video in Seattle (some advertisement there) I found it released as an uncut version for region 1 DVD's. Plus, it was widescreen. I enjoyed it immensely.",positive
"Overrated piece of s**t. First of all, I like horror films and have nothing against blood, gore & violence if it has any meaning to the film. But most of the gore in this film has no meaning at all, it just seems that Fulci was obsessed with overexaggerated scenes of blood & guts. For example the scene where a man falls from a ladder in the library. If it was some other director the man would have simply fallen and died when he hit the floor. But thats not enough for Fulci! After the fall the man is attacked by spiders who shred his face into a bloody mess! Really, what does that have to do with the rest of the film? Overall I think Fulci is way overrated. The reason i hunted down some of his movies (they are not too easy to get hold of in Sweden. Especially uncut) was that I had seen on the Internet that many horror-fans consider him one of the greatest horror-directors. I now have seen New York Ripper, Zombie, House By The Cemetary and this one and I find all of them to be plain garbage. It seems to me that Fulci was without any talent whatsoever. This movie is not scary, not funny, it is just ludicrous. The only way you can get something out of watching this is if you like to watch bad films like Plan 9 From Outer Space or if think it is fun to watch lots of fake-looking gore.",negative
